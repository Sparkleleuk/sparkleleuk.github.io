<p>I set up Sustainability Matters to democratize access to content about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. I&rsquo;d like to help you understand that government policies, corporate actions and general current events have impacts on sustainability and therefore, they matter to you and me. I&rsquo;d want to help you make  informed decisions and take action to make the world a healthier, safer and more sustainable place to live in.</p>
<p>Sustainability Matters is not an aggregator or a curator of sustainability news. Instead, I select news stories that have broad relevance, then I provide a succinct analysis of what the story means and why the issue matters. If you are interested in sustainability news but find it difficult or are too busy to find them, or you have some familiarity with sustainability and understand that this is relevant to you, this blog may help you. You might just learn a thing or two in less than five minutes of reading a day.</p>
<h3 id="and-what-about-the-newsletter">And What About the Newsletter?</h3>
<p>I will send you a recap of the highlights every two weeks through the Sustainability Matters newsletter. If you are a subscriber, please whitelist Sustainability Matters by adding <a href="mailto:sustainabilityinfoservice@gmail.com">sustainabilityinfoservice@gmail.com</a>  to your contact list. In this way, the newsletter does not go to your spam or clutter boxes, or does not get blocked by firewall.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-sustainability-matters">Who is Sustainability Matters?</h3>
<p>My name is Sheila Oviedo and I founded Sustainability Matters in 2017 with plenty of help from Marcel Schoffelmeer. I have been in the ESG space for 10 years and counting. The making of this site was powered by Kenya AA coffee and Trader Joe’s Mango &amp; Cream Bars. The maintenance is powered by mochi ice cream. Lots of them.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>This blog is independent and not affiliated with any firm, political entity or civil society group. I take full responsibility for the analysis and opinions on this site and newsletter.</p>
